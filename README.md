# description

This application uses React to show a portfolio about myself. In the application, you can view an About Me, Portfolio, Contact Me, and Resume page.
In the About Me is just a brief description of what I have learned with technologies and languages. It also has links to some social media accounts.
In the Portfolio, I have displayed screenshots of 3 projects/homework I have completed and feel proud about. The link to visit the website and the repository are also available on the page.
In the Contact Me, you can enter your name, email, and write a comment. It also shows my contact information to get in contact with me directly.
Lastly, the Resume part has a screen shot of my most recent Resume. It also has a link next to it to download the PDF. At the bottom of the page, I have also added a few proficiencies.

Enjoy!
